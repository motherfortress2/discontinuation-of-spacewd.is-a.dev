# Hello friends, SpaceWD here.
I have a website called spacewd.is-a.dev and i am shutting it down permenantly.
# Why am i shutting it down?
i've just gotten tired of having this subdomain and i am already running another website on neocities.
# When and how will the site be deleted?
i will first delete all of my repositories contianing that domain, then i will delete the domain from the is-a.dev website.
